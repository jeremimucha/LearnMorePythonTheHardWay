# Process to follow before starting a 'hacking' session

1. Get you computer ready and make sure you a re ready to go.
2. Read the description of the task and write down notes.
   This is your research phase and you need to gather as much information as
   you can in written form.
3. Take your research and turn it into a TODO list of what you need to do to
   implement the hack. Write donw everyting you can think of for the task.
   What files will you need to make? What directories? What features?
   What libraries will you use?

Once you have the TODO list you are ready to start the timer. During your
hacking session you will then do this:

1. Pick the first simplest task on your TODO and do it.
2. Check that what you just did works.
3. Cross that task off and do the next one.


## General process to follow

1. Do a little research about the problem you're about to solve
2. Write down some ideas that pop into your head.
  * What libraries would I like to use, or could implement for this task
  * How should I structure my code? How many files? Classes?
  * If you have any concrete ideas for a implementation of a feature, write it down!
3. Make a feature list. Make sure what you're writing down can actually be considered 'features'. Can't be too vague, can't be too minor.
4. Make a TODO list. Split it up into general tasks and per-feature tasks.
5. Solve the problem by implementing each task on the TODO list. Don't be overly strict, jump between the tasks if you have to.
6. Implement the tasks in 35-45 minute sessions. Try to implement unit tests as you go. After each session take a short break (10 min?), go back and do a code audit. If you didn't write unit tests do it now.
7. Keep track of defects as you audit and test your code. Divide them into categories. Maybe:
  * Syntax
  * Logic
  * Pointer misuse
  * ?
8. Write down post-project observations. In all of the areas you're tracking:
    * startup process,
    * mental state/attitude when starting and while working
    * work environment (distractions?), what can be changed to make work easier and make focusing on work easier
    * physical state - posture, shoulder position, neck position, wrists, tensening of muscles, etc
9. Calculate personal metrics after the hack
  * Defect statistics
  * Feature implementation statistics
  * Working hours
