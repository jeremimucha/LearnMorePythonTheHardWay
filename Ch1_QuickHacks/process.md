# Process to follow before starting a 'hacking' session

1. Get you computer ready and make sure you a re ready to go.
2. Read the description of the task and write down notes.
   This is your research phase and you need to gather as much information as
   you can in written form.
3. Take your research and turn it into a TODO list of what you need to do to
   implement the hack. Write donw everyting you can think of for the task.
   What files will you need to make? What directories? What features?
   What libraries will you use?

Once you have the TODO list you are ready to start the timer. During your
hacking session you will then do this:

1. Pick the first simplest task on your TODO and do it.
2. Check that what you just did works.
3. Cross that task off and do the next one.
